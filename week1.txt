XMC 4700/4800 Relax Kit

RAM: 352 KB
Flash Memory: 2MB
Cortex M4 processor
3 push buttons( 2 user defined and 1 reset button)
2 LEDs
Processer: XMC 4700/4800
Debugger: XMC 4200

Two 40 pin headers(X1 & X2)
	This are assembled only in the EtherCAT versions.

X101: Debugger micro-usb port

UART

0	Rx
1	Tx

SPI

5	CLK
4	MISO
3	MOSI
2	CS

I2C

17	SCL
16	SDA

CAN 

X2.33	CANH
X2.35	CANL

Has on chip level shifter(3.3v and 5v)
Paraller operations of I2C and ADC4 and ADC5 is not possible because they share same arduino pins.
SD card slot can be assembled to the board at the port x401 using SPI interface.


After power-up the green DEBUG LED starts blinking. In case there is a connection to a PC via the Debug USB
plug X101 and the USB Debug Device drivers are installed on this PC, the DEBUG LED will turn from blinking to
constant illumination.

The green Power LED (VDD3.3) indicates the presence of the generated 3.3 V supply voltage.

XMC2GO

RAM: 16KB
Flash Memory: 64KB

Processor: XMC 1100
Debugger: XMC 4200

Cortex M0 processor

Two 8 pin headers(X1 and X2)
2 user LEDs
Works on 3.3V
The Power&Debug LED indicates the presence of the generated 3.3V supply voltage.

An on-board reverse current protection diode will ensure safe operation and protects the USB port of the Laptop/PC in case power is provided through the pin header X1.
